- Inconsistency in interview processes
- Limited availability for 24/7 candidate screening
- Need for standardized evaluation criteria

### 1.3 Objectives

**Primary Objective:**
To develop an AI-powered interview bot capable of conducting preliminary screening interviews with candidates.

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Implement natural language understanding for interview responses
- Create an evaluation system for candidate responses
- Design a user-friendly interface for both candidates and recruiters
- Ensure fair and unbiased assessment processes

### 1.4 Scope and Limitations

**Scope:**
- [Define what your system does]
